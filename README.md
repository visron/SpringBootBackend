Sample project used to learn spring boot for backend development
## Getting Started

### Reference Documentation

### Guides

The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:

* [Accessing data with MySQL](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/)
* [Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)

## Technologies
* Java 11
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for dependency management and build control
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - a traditional Spring web application
  that runs 24/7
    * [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) is used as higher level layer
      of repository
    * JPA as ORM(with [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) implementation)


### Run through docker
If you want to develop locally, you need to run a local Mysql instance.
First pull version 5.7 image of Mysql

> docker pull mysql/mysql-server:5.7

Then start the container

> docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306  --name springtest -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD={mysql password} -d mysql/mysql-server:5.7

Now the container is running; you need to login once to create the database;

> docker exec -it springtest bash

This logs you in onto the container, but not yet into Mysql. You need the following command for that:

> mysql -p
> 
This starts up Mysql with prompting for a password;
use the Mysql password. 
Now you are logged in the database server, and you only have to create the springtest database; 
use the following SQL statement

> CREATE DATABASE SPRINGTEST;

Next, you have to grant external connection access (Mysql blocks this by default);

> CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{MYSQL PASSWORD}';
> 
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
> 
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Now you can start the springBootBackend app; the app will connect to the Mysql database, will query the database.
